# Machine Learning with Learn-Scikit

## Introduction

Project AI4 focuses on learning machine learning methods using the Learn-Scikit library. The project is divided into four phases, which involve exploring and analyzing the dataset, preprocessing, implementing and optimizing models using Learn-Scikit's classifiers, and finally implementing group learning methods using the optimized models.

## Phase Zero: EDA and Visualization

In this phase, we perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization on the dataset. We answer questions and perform tasks such as:

- Checking the overall structure of the data using the `describe` and `info` methods.
- Calculating the percentage of data lost in each feature due to missing values.
- Drawing distribution charts for numeric and non-numeric properties.

## Phase One: Preprocessing

In this phase, we preprocess the data. Some of the tasks performed are:

- Scaling the data using standardization to bring all features to a common scale.
- Encoding categorical data into numerical format using Label Encoding.

## Phase Two: Model Implementation and Optimization

This phase involves implementing and optimizing models using Learn-Scikit's classifiers. Some of the tasks performed include:

- Dividing the data into training and testing sets.
- Implementing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree models.
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters to find the optimal settings for the models.

## Phase Three: Group Learning and Analysis

In the final phase, we implement group learning methods using the optimal models from Phase Two. We analyze the results and perform tasks such as:

- Drawing model accuracy charts for KNN and Decision Tree based on the number of neighbors and tree depth.
- Displaying confusion matrices for the trained models.

## Conclusion

Project AI4 provides an in-depth understanding of machine learning methods, preprocessing techniques, and model optimization using the Learn-Scikit library. By following the phases of the project, participants gain practical experience in working with real-world datasets and applying machine learning concepts.
